# 🏡 House prediction model
This project is a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features. It utilizes regression algorithms to learn from historical housing data and estimate prices.

## 📌 Features
  Data cleaning and preprocessing
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Feature selection and engineering
  Model training and evaluation
  Price prediction using regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
  Visualization of results

## 🧰 Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
	pandas
	numpy
	matplotlib
	seaborn
	scikit-learn

## ⚙ Installation
1)Clone the repository:
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git

cd house-price-prediction

2) Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook house_price.ipynb

## 🚀 Usage
1)Launch the notebook.
2)Follow the sections:
	Load and clean the data
	Perform EDA
	Apply transformations and feature engineering
	Train ML models
	Predict house prices
	Modify the input features to test predictions on custom data.

## 🧠 Code Overview
Data Loading: Reads dataset using pandas.
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values, encoding, outliers.
EDA: Visualizes distributions, correlations, and trends.
Modeling: Trains regression models and evaluates using metrics like RMSE or R².
Prediction: Predicts house prices for test data.
